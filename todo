what we need to do is:
we need to make the table preview columns always the max possible
which means in the csv file, there is 29 csv which is totall columns, but we want in the future if we add new column the table preview will now display 30 columns
what about the nulls or impossible data fileds, those fields will be disabled, so you can not input value into them and YOU SHOULD NEVER BE able

the second thing is dynamic inputs, the input fields are not dynamic as it should
so we should fix this problem and test the logic, then it should be working

the third problem the material should be before the company

the fourth problem we need to add search and filter functionality in the preview tab

the fifth problem we need to refactor the existing code(after passing the four problems above)
so we can utilise it for the other entry pages easily, so we ne the code repoducible and reusbale
