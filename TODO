we need to make a good manage.py file, by supporting different things like create_superuser, create_tables, ...etc.
and then delete the script files [migrated into manage.py]

in examples directory `from app.database.connection import get_async_session` is not existing
we need playwright e2e test to test the basic three flows to create nodes and edit and delete and so

"Unresolved reference 'ManufacturingType' "
Expected type 'str | Sequence[ColumnClause | _HasClauseElement | DMLColumnRole | Mapped] | () -> Sequence[ColumnClause | _HasClauseElement | DMLColumnRole | Mapped] | () -> ColumnClause | _HasClauseElement | DMLColumnRole | Mapped | ColumnClause | _HasClauseElement | DMLColumnRole | Mapped | None', got 'list[int]' instead
    manufacturing_type: Mapped[ManufacturingType | None] = relationship(
        "ManufacturingType",
        back_populates="attribute_nodes",
    )
    parent: Mapped[AttributeNode | None] = relationship(
        "AttributeNode",
        remote_side=[id],
        back_populates="children",
        foreign_keys=[parent_node_id],
    )
    children: Mapped[list[AttributeNode]] = relationship(
        "AttributeNode",
        back_populates="parent",
        foreign_keys=[parent_node_id],
        cascade="all, delete-orphan",
    )


a lot of different files at repoistories folder have common functions name so i think we should make them consistent by making a class or something
